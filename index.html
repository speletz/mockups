<h2>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<h4>
<a id="inneficient" class="anchor" href="#inneficient" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inneficient</h4>

<p>Paying for parking is an inefficient process that requires manually feeding coins into the parking meter one by one. </p>

<h4>
<a id="payment-methods" class="anchor" href="#payment-methods" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Payment methods</h4>

<p>Paying for parking with coins is a major pain point for parking meter users. </p>

<h4>
<a id="incremental-time-added-model" class="anchor" href="#incremental-time-added-model" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Incremental Time Added Model</h4>

<p>The model of adding time incrementally often results in overpaying or underpaying and receiving a parking ticket. </p>

<h4>
<a id="no-proof-of-payment" class="anchor" href="#no-proof-of-payment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No proof of payment</h4>

<p>Paying for metered parking does not ensure proof of payment and no receipt is given after the payment. </p>

<h2>
<a id="our-proposal" class="anchor" href="#our-proposal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Proposal</h2>

<p>We chose to design a smartphone interface for startup MeterFeeder. MeterFeeder is used to bring parking meter payments to mobile, in an attempt to fix the outdated parking system. Out interface facilitates the payment process, which starts when the user parks one's car and ends when a user has paid for their parking spot and leaves their spot. </p>

<p>In our design, the user no longer has to predict how long they're staying, worry about forgetting to pay, or refill the meter. The user is also able to find their car if they have forgotten where it was parked. Our app launches a home screen, which updates a map using the smartphone's geolocation. The user can see the rate and the time limit for spots in their municipality and select to park. The user confirms their car and credit card and clicks to begin parking. Once the user wants to leave the parking space, they can click to stop parking. The user then confirms the payment or can choose to continue parking. </p>

<p>We have created a very simple, efficient two-click process to start parking and two click-process to stop and pay for parking. By containing the actions required to when someone is parking and leaving a parking spot, they do not need to be preoccupied about feeding a parking meter throughout the day. Debit and credit cards will be the form of payment in our app. By diverging from the traditional incremental time added model, we are able to implement a simpler start/stop parking system. Our app provides a proof of payment where there wasn't before. A history of parking transactions is easily accessible, which would be beneficial upon receiving an unwarranted parking ticket. </p>

<h4>
<a id="mobile" class="anchor" href="#mobile" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile</h4>

<p>Our solution is a mobile interface for parkers on-the-go. </p>

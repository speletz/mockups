# A New Parking Meter Payment UI
How paying for parking should be

### The Problem
Paying for parking is inefficient, ... 

#### Payment methods
Paying for parking with coins is a major pain point for parking meter users. 

#### Incremental Time Added Model


### Our Proposal
We chose to design a smartphone interface for startup MeterFeeder. MeterFeeder is used to bring parking meter payments to mobile, in an attempt to fix the outdated parking system. Out interface facilitates the payment process, which starts when the user parks one's car and ends when a user has paid for their parking spot and leaves their spot. 

Debit and credit cards will be the form of payment in our app. By diverging from the traditional incremental time added model, we are able to implement a simpler start/stop parking system. Through a mobile app, we are also able to make a history of parking transactions accessible, which would be beneficial upon receiving an unwarranted parking ticket. 

#### Mobile
Our solution is a mobile interface for parkers on-the-go. 

Try the prototype yourself!
